  “Responsible Artificial Intelligence” at the University of Freiburg. He earned his

  Philosophy in Experimental Psychology from the University of Cambridge. At ICA4,
  he proposes to discuss the question of how to effectively govern and regulate emerging
  AI-based neurotechnologies in the consumer domain, given that emerging direct-to

  would like to further develop a multi-level governance approach for brain data and
  neurotechnology that he has been working on with colleagues in neuroethics and AI. '
