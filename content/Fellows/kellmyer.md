presentation: 'Philipp Kellmeyer is a neurologist, neuroscientist and researcher in
  neuroethics and AI ethics. He is Professor at the University of Freiburg, and co-founder
  of the Saltus! Group “Responsible Artificial Intelligence” at the Freiburg Institute
  for Advanced Studies (FRIAS). He earned his PhD in Neurology from University of
  Freiburg in 2009. At ICA4, he proposes to discuss the question of how to effectively
  govern and regulate emerging AI-based neurotechnology in the consumer domain, given
  that emerging direct-to consumer systems pose substantial legal and ethical challenges.
  Specifically, he would like to further develop a multi-level governance approach
  to brain data and neurotechnology that he has been working on with colleagues in
  neuroethics and AI. '
