  Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and coordinator of the
  Bioinformatics graduate program at the University of São Paulo (USP), he received
  his PhD from USP in 2007. Generally, his research focuses on understanding how the
  interaction of biological components (molecules, genes, cells, tissues, individuals,
  environment) raises a specific phenotype. To this end, he developed statistical
  methods for networks and applied them to analyze "omics" and fMRI/EEG data. He has
  received several awards and fellowships for his work in Germany, Japan, the UK,
  and the USA, and he will contribute to ICA4 with his interdisciplinary experience
  and expertise in biological network analysis. '
