presentation: 'Massimiliano Di Luca is a cognitive scientist with a background in
  engineering and psychology. Currently holding the position of Senior Lecturer at
  University of Birminghamâ€™s School of Psychology, he has previously been a research
  scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics working on Bayesian
  modelling, a visiting scholar at Oculus, and seconded as a research scientist at
  Facebook Reality Labs where he worked on VR. His work bridges the disciplines of
  neuroscience, cognitive science, and engineering in investigating cognitive models
  that capture how humans process and act on sensory information or behave in social
  settings. At ICA4, he would like to find ways to build virtual musicians who mimic
  the synergistic experience of an actual rehearsal. His second proposal is to work
  on human-machine interaction by building model-based AI solutions that will allow
  both a deeper scientific understanding of the human cognitive system and a richer
  and more effective behavior of artificial agents. '
