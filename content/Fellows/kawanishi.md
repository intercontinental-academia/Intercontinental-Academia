presentation:
  'Yasutomo Kawanishi received his Ph.D. degree in Informatics from Kyoto
  University, Japan, in 2012. Since 2021, he has been a team leader at RIKEN Guardian
  Robot Project. His main research field is Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
  His research interests are robot vision for environmental understanding and surveillance
  for human understanding, especially pedestrian detection, tracking, retrieval, and
  recognition. At ICA4, he would like to focus on two questions: “How can humans remember
  and recall the 3D environment around them?” and “Can this functionality be implemented
  on robots?”. He would like to work on incorporating knowledge from cognitive science
  and neuroscience into the robot vision field.'
