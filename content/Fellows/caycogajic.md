presentation: 'Natasha Alex Cayco Gajic is a neuroscientist who works on recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs) in flexible learning. She is junior professor at École Normale
  Supérieure in Paris, where she is in the Group for Neural Theory at the Laboratory
  for Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience. Previously, she was research associate
  at University College London. She received her PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2015
  from the University of Washington. For her project at the 4th Intercontinental Academia,
  she proposes to investigate the links between sensorimotor and cognitive behaviors
  with a focus on cerebello-cortical coordination. In particular, she wishes to explore
  how a cognitive internal model in the cerebellum could aid the neocortex in adapting
  to unexpected changes in cognitive tasks. '
