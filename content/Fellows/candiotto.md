  'Laura Candiotto is a philosopher of emotion who works on the epistemology
  of emotions. She is Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Ethics as Study in
  Human Value at the University of Pardubice. She was a visiting scholar at the IMèRA
  Institute for Advance Study of the Aix-Marseille University (2018-2019) and she
  received her PhD in philosophy in 2011 at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. At ICA4,
  she aims to explore the philosophical significance of our engagement with affective
  robots simulating human emotions, as in the case of care robots. She would like
  to analyze the affective intentionality in the human-robot embodied interactions
  and discuss the ethical and societal implications of affective robotics. '
