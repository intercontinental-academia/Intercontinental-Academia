presentation: 'Oksana Stalnov is a scientist who is driven by natural curiosity to
  understand physical processes and desire to make a difference in the world. Her
  work brings together knowledge from across different disciplines, enabling development
  of smart acoustic systems through understanding, predicting, and controlling generation
  of aerodynamic noise. During her academic career, she has had the pleasure of solving
  problems in the field of Engineering, primarily in aerodynamics and aeroacoustics,
  and more specifically in the fields of noise control, modeling, and analysis. She
  is particularly excited about using acoustic emission (AE) technique combined with
  artificial intelligence (AI) methods, for instance condition monitoring and flow
  state detection and diagnostics. She holds that AI can dramatically transform our
  society, not so much in terms of what we can do today, but rather what can be achieved
  in the near future, if we combine machine learning with physics-based models. '
