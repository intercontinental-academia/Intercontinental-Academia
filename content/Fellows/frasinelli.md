presentation: 'Diego Frassinelli’s research aims to enhance the understanding of cognitive
  processes engaged in language comprehension and processing. Having received his
  Ph.D. in Informatics from University of Edinburgh in 2015, he is now Assistant Professor
  in Artificial Intelligence at University of Konstanz (Germany) and has been a visiting
  researcher at UCL’s Language and Cognition Lab since 2016. He takes an interdisciplinary
  approach using tools from both computational linguistics and psycholinguistics to
  address questions targeting the ways speakers integrate multimodal linguistic and
  non-linguistic contextual information in the processing of upcoming linguistic input.
  Recently, his research has been moving towards the use of large-scale human behavioral
  data (e.g., reading and reaction times, eye-movements, linguistic norms) to describe
  and understand the behavior of computational linguistic models. His proposal for
  ICA4 is to investigate cultural aspects of language and to leverage interdisciplinarity
  to identify and model such very rich and diversified information with computational
  approaches.  '
