presentation: 'Ithai Rabinowitch is a neurobiologist and synthetic biologist, Assistant
  Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His
  research focuses on the tiny (1mm-long) nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, taking
  advantage of its relatively simple nervous system to unravel molecular and cellular
  underpinnings of presumed early precursors of intelligence. Concomitantly, the amenability
  of C. elegans to genetic manipulation makes it possible to reconfigure its neural
  circuits, and thus incorporate human design into its behavior, opening the way for
  a new animal-based form of AI. At ICA4 he would like to collaboratively conceptualize
  an imaginative yet concrete animal AI archetype, and use it to contemplate about
  the significance and foreseeable consequences of human-endowed animal intelligence. '
