presentation: 'Henry Taylor primarily works on the interface of philosophy and cognitive
  science. He is especially interested in how philosophy can productively work with
  psychophysics to address questions concerning perception, consciousness and attention.
  His project for ICA4 involves using natural kinds theory to inform research at the
  interface of human psychology and artificial intelligence, for example in the development
  of more useful and scientifically productive definitions of psychological faculties
  such as working memory, attention, and consciousness. Natural kinds theory is the
  philosophical study of scientific classification: how scientists define certain
  key scientific concepts and ideas; and how these concepts group the phenomena that
  they study. He was awarded his PhD from the University of Durham in 2015, for a
  thesis on attention and its relation to consciousness. He was then a Leverhulme
  Early Career Fellow at the University of Cambridge, working on the metaphysics of
  consciousness. He has been a Birmingham Fellow at University of Birmingham since
  2017. '
