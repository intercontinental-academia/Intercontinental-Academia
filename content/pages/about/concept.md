The Intercontinental Academia (ICA) creates a **global network of future research leaders in which some of the very best young academics work together on paradigm-shifting, cross-disciplinary research, mentored by eminent researchers from across the globe**.

ICA was brought to life by the coalition of [University-Based Institutes for Advanced Study (UBIAS)](http://www.ubias.net/about-the-institute). Initiated in 2010, UBIAS counts 32 member institutes which, next to being international environments for exceptional research, contribute to the academic achievements of their respective home universities. The conference is one of the many projects through which UBIAS connects outstanding researchers from across the globe, championing intercultural awareness, mutual exchange, and innovation.

During the Intercontinental Academia, participants get together in three sessions over the course of one year. The experience is expected to transform the scholar'sâ€™ own approach to research, enhance their awareness of the work, relevance and potential impact of other disciplines, and to inspire and facilitate new collaborations between distant disciplines. The aim is to make a real, yet volatile, intellectual cocktail leading to meaningful exchange and long-lasting outputs.

Previous editions of ICA have had great success in building bridges between continents, cultures, and disciplines:
