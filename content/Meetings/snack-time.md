**Stigmergy** ([/ˈstɪɡmərdʒi/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_STIG-mər-jee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a mechanism of indirect [coordination](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coordination "wikt:coordination"), through the environment, between agents or actions.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy#cite_note-mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de-1) The principle is that the trace left in the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment") by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent. Agents that respond to traces in the environment receive positive fitness benefits, reinforcing the likelihood of these behaviors becoming fixed within a population over time.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy#cite_note-2)

Stigmergy is a form of [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization"). It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who may lack memory or individual awareness of each other.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy#cite_note-mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de-1)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy#cite_note-3)
