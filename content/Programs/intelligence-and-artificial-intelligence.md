This 4th edition of ICA will explore fundamental interdisciplinary questions at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Decisive advances have been made during the past decades in the analysis of brain activity and its behavioral counterparts, as well as in the information processing sciences. Complementarities between neuroscience/ cognitive science and artificial intelligence provide grounds for exploring synergies and raising ethical questions between these disciplines that hold tremendous challenges and opportunities for societal progress.

On the occasion of the visit of high-level researchers, the organizing institutions plan in parallel a set of "side events" open to all.

Conferences and workshops will be scheduled at some of the major Parisian university partners of the IEA de Paris.

A satellite session, Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence (IAI), is programmed to last four days, from June 5 to 8, 2021, in parallel to the ICA4 meeting in Belo Horizonte. The event will consist of lectures and discussion round tables, with the participation of ICA4 mentors and other guests from academia and the productive sector. The activities will take place at the campus of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), with live streaming to partner institutions. The themes to be discussed are (i) Foundations and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, (ii) Intelligence and rationality, (iii) Cognition and Neurosciences, (iv) Interdisciplinary explorations of artificial intelligence, (v) AI in health sciences, among others.
