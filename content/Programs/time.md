The pilot project for the Intercontinental Academia operated as a joint venture of IEA-USP (Sao Paulo, Brasil) and the IAR (Institute for Advanced Research) of the Nagoya University (Nagoya, Japan). This edition was guided by three goals: to stimulate joint research among UBIAS members; to establish cooperation networks among the next generationâ€™s scientific leaders; and to explore new forms of collective academic practices and new formats of scientific training, collaboration and dissemination. Cyclical or linear, measurable or incalculable, vast or microscopic, eternal or finite, relativist or absolute, time as a concept (or a reality) affects us all. From astrophysics to chronobiology, from philosophy to anthropology, participants have expanded on this issue in their varied disciplines exploring how time plays a pivotal role in shaping the world around us, and consequently shaping our understanding of it. The meetings led to the filming of a MOOC on Time and a documentary that sums up this first edition of ICA.
