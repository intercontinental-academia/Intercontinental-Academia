The third edition of ICA was a joint venture of The Nanyang Technological University IAS in Singapore and The University of Birmingham IAS in Birmingham, UK. The goal of ICA3 was to look at laws in different fields of study (natural and physical, social and political...), encouraging researchers to find commonalities between seemingly distant disciplines and to open minds to new methods of investigation. Looking at laws and tensions that arise from them, participants questioned how laws originate, how and why they are broken, as well as the enforcement or manifestation thereof across various disciplines. Two years later, some participants are still in touch and working on joint projects with researchers they have met at ICA3.
