Aix-Marseille School of Economics (AMSE) is a project combining a research unit (UMR 7316), a graduate school and an outreach department.

AMSE is an innovative and original project centered on the fundamental concerns of our societies. Research and teaching are carefully combined to train a new generation of economists capable of dealing with all the challenges of a world in crisis, capable of putting their knowledge of economics to work for citizens and policymakers.
