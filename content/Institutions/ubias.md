UBIAS stands for “University-Based Institutes for Advanced Study”. Unlike traditional Institutes for Advanced Study, UBIAS institutes are associated with or embedded within a university, and actively contribute to the academic culture and the scientific achievements of their home university. The network now comprises 44 member institutes in 21 countries.
