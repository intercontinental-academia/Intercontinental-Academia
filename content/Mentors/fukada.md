presentation: 'Toshio Fukada is a world-leading researcher in robotics, with special
  interest in intelligent robotic systems, micro-nano robotics, bio-robotic system
  and neuromorphic intelligent control. Among his greatest achievements are the development
  of continuous movement in robots and his pioneering microrobotics technology that
  has been a decisive contribution to medical technology. Laureate of the 1997 Dr.-Ing.
  Eugene Mittelmann Achievement Award, 2000 IEEE Third Millennium Medal, and 2011
  IEEE/RSJ IROS Harashima Award for Innovative Technology, he is Professor at the
  Beijing Institute for Technology, Emeritus professor at Nagoya University, and 2019
  President-Elect of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. '
