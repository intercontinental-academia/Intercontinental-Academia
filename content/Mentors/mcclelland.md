presentation: 'James McClelland is a cognitive psychologist best known for his work
  on statistical learning, parallel distributed processing (PDP), and applying neural
  networks to explain cognitive phenomena such as spoken word recognition, language
  processing, and memory. Currently, his work focuses on the development of mathematical
  cognition. He teaches on the PDP approach to cognition and its neural underpinnings
  and is a consulting research scientist at DeepMind. Laureate of the 2005 Mind &
  Brain Prize, 2010 Rumelhart Prize, and 2014 de Carvalho-Heineken Prize, he is the
  Lucie Stern Professor at Stanford University, where he co-directs the Center for
