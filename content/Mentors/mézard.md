presentation: 'Marc Mézard is a physicist whose research is rooted in statistical
  physics with broad applications in physics and beyond, including spin glass theory,
  biology, neural networks or information theory. His current work is at the heart
  of progress made in AI in recent years, covering questions of deep learning and
  task solving in deep neural networks. Laureate of the 1996 Ampère Prize of the French
  Academy of Sciences, 2009 Humboldt Prize, and 2016 Lars Onsager Prize of the American
  Physical Society, he has been director of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in
  Paris since 2012. '
