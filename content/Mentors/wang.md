presentation: 'Xiao-Jing Wang is a computational neuroscientist, expert on the neurobiology
  of executive and cognitive functions. Known for pioneering neural-circuit models
  of the prefrontal cortex, he is now applying findings on short-term memory, decision-making,
  communication, and synchronization through inhibitory neurons to develop neurobiologically-realistic
  large-scale brain circuit models of cognitively controlled flexible behavior. In
  2017, he was awarded the Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience,
  in 2018 the Goldman-Rakic Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Cognitive Neuroscience.
  He is Associate Vice Chancellor for Research at NYU Shanghai, and Professor of Neural
  Science at New York University. '
