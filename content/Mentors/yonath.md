presentation: 'Ada Yonath is a cristallographer, laureate, among other distinctions,
  of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her pioneering work on the structure and
  functions of the ribosome - the cell’s protein factory. She has been at the forefront
  of key scientific developments, revealing in detail how genetic information is decoded,
  how the ribosome''s inherent flexibility contributes to antibiotic selectivity and
  the secrets of cross-resistance to various antibiotic families. Her findings are
  crucial for developing advanced antibiotics. She is the Martin S. and Helen Kimmel
  Professor of Structural Biology at the Weizmann Institute and heads the Kimmelman
  Center for Biomolecular Structure and Assembly. '
