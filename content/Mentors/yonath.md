title_and_institution: Professor of Structural Biology at Weizmann Institute and the
  laureate of 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
presentation: "Ada Yonath is a member of several academies, including US national
  Academy, the British Royal Society, the Israeli Academy. Among other distinctions,
  she holds honorary doctorate from over 40 worldwide universities. Her pioneering
  studies focus on the structure and functions of the ribosome – the cell’s protein
  factory. She has been at the forefront of key         scientific developments, revealing
  in detail how genetic     information is decoded, how the ribosome's inherent         flexibility
  enables its performance, how antibiotics target it selectively and the secrets of
  antibiotic cross-resistance, findings that are crucial for designing next generation
  eco-friendly antibiotics. She also investigates human diseases associated with mutated
  ribosomes, and attempts discovering the origin of life.  \nYonath is the Martin
  and Helen Kimmel Professor and heads the Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure
  and Assembly at the Weizmann Institute. "
