  Sir Martin Rees was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2012. His
  main research interests have been galaxy formation, cosmic jets, black holes, and
  gamma ray bursts. More speculatively, he is interested in the question of whether

  and more demanding population are placing on environment, sustainability, and biodiversity,
  and the impact of powerful recent technologies. He co-founded the Centre for the

  these issues.  '
