presentation: 'Shimon Ullman is a computer scientist whose general area of research
  is the study of vision. He studies the processing of visual information by the human
  visual system, and computer vision with the aim of understanding how our own visual
  system operates, and how to construct artificial systems with visual capabilities.
  Among his many awards and distinctions are the 2008 David E. Rumelhart Prize in
  human cognition, the Israel Prize in Computer Science in 2015, and the Azriel Rozenfeld
  Achievement Award in Computer vision in 2019. He is Samy and Ruth Cohn Professor
  of Computer Science at The Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot (Israel) and
  Director of the Weizmann AI center. '
