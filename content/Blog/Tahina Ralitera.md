Living in a modern age, it's almost impossible to have not heard of a rather fascinating concept: **Blockchain!**

This is precisely what [Tahina](/fellows#ralitera "Tahina Ralitera") is investigating! She is a Research Engineer at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).

She also explores **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** for modelling and simulation of complex and adaptive systems.

Have a look at her research pitch!

For **ICA4**, Tahina will be investigating how to tackle open problems related to the economy of **Decentralised Exchanges** using **rational agents**.

Want to know more about **Tahina Ralitera**?

Laureate of the 2017 L’Oréal UNESCO for women in science French fellowship, She is a PhD and computer engineer, specialised in agent-based modelling and simulation. She works as a research engineer at the Laboratory for Trustworthy, Smart and Self-Organizing Systems (LICIA) of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), Saclay, France. Her current research interests are agent-based engineering and simulation for the design and the implementation of blockchain-based solutions for drone systems. She is very active in the fight for gender equality and especially in promoting women's participation in science. In this context, she is ambassadress of the L'Oréal Foundation "For Girls in Science" program and member of the "Elles Bougent" association.
