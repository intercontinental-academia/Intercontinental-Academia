Listen to Henry as he discusses **the interface between cognitive science and philosophy** with Mike Livermore in an ICA4 podcast.

- Attention (what is attention? How does attention interact with perception, and consciousness?)
- Consciousness (is consciousness just a feature of the brain? How should consciousness be studied scientifically?)
- Perception (can perception occur unconsciously?)
- The metaphysics of properties (how should we understand the properties that make up our world?)

Henry works in the philosophy of mind broadly construed, and is especially interested in the interface between cognitive science and philosophy. He is currently focussing mainly on natural kinds in psychology. Psychologists use particular categories to talk about the mind, such as _consciousness_, _memory,_ and _perception_. Henry is interested in how these categories are developed, and what they must be like in order to explain the success of science.

Curious about the ICA4 fellow?

**Henry Taylor** is a Senior Lecturer in University of Birmingham. Before Birmingham, he was a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Cambridge.
