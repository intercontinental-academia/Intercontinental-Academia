I work in the philosophy of mind broadly construed. I am especially interested in the interface between cognitive science and philosophy.

I am currently focussing mainly on natural kinds in psychology. Psychologists use particular categories to talk about the mind, such as _consciousness_, _memory,_ and _perception_. I am interested in how these categories are developed, and what they must be like in order to explain the success of science. I am currently writing a monograph on this topic.

Other interests include:

* Attention (what is attention? How does attention interact with perception, and consciousness?)
* Consciousness (is consciousness just a feature of the brain? How should consciousness be studied scientifically?)
* Perception (can perception occur unconsciously?)
* The metaphysics of properties (how should we understand the properties that make up our world?)

I am also very interested in visual crowding. This is when objects in the periphery of the visual field become harder to identify when placed near other objects. I have mainly worked on this with [Dr Bilge Sayim,](http://appearancelab.org/researchteam/bilge.html) a perceptual psychologist at the University of Bern.

Before Birmingham, I was a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Cambridge. I got my PhD in 2015 from the University of Durham.
