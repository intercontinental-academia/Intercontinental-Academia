**Artificial intelligence** might seem rather unrelated to **law and legal institutions**. However, this is definitely not the case! The **intersection** of the two is precisely what interests [Mike](/fellows#livermore "Mike Livermore"). So, how can the law be adapted by AI research? Have a look at his video!

Quite fascinatingly, Mike's project for ICA4 explores **how data-driven artificial intelligence techniques can be used to construct models of legal and moral reasoning that can address important outstanding questions in systems design**.

Wondering about Mike's background?

**Michael A. Livermore** is a law scholar who uses artificial intelligence tools to understand the law and legal institutions. He frequently collaborates on interdisciplinary projects with researchers in other academic fields, including economics, computer science, neurology and the humanities. His substantive areas of expertise are environmental law, cost-benefit analysis, and regulatory law and policy. Currently Law professor at the University of Virginia, he earned his J.D. from New York University School of Law and served as a law clerk to Judge Harry T. Edwards on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Listen to his **ICA4 podcast**, through which he talks about **Legal AI** in an interview with Henry Taylor, another ICA4 fellow!
