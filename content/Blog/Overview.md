[**The Intercontinental Academia (ICA)**](/about#concept "ICA Concept") seeks to create a global network of future research leaders in which some of the very best early/mid‐career scholars will work together on paradigm‐shifting cross‐disciplinary research, mentored by some of the most eminent researchers from across the globe. <!--more-->

[The 4th edition of the ICA](/about#ica4 "ICA4") explores the complementarities between **artificial intelligence and neuro/cognitive-science** and the tremendous challenges and opportunities they raise for humanity. Fellows and mentors initially met online and in **cyberspace**, and now in presence in **Paris**, from October 18 to 27. They shall meet again in cyberspace in the next few months and then finally, in Belo Horizonte in Brazil next June.

The 1st session, hosted by [Paris Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)](https://www.paris-iea.fr/en/ "Paris IAS"), includes an intense 10-days of scientific sessions, discussion forums as well as **scientific exchanges** with ENS-Paris Saclay, Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence and Ecole Normale Supérieure.

Members of Paris IAS in alphabetical order are:

* Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales
* Ecole Normale Supérieure
* Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes
* Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme - Inalco
* The Île-de-France Region
* The French Network of Institutes for Advanced Studies
* Laboratory of Excellence - Sorbonne University
* University of Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle
* University of Paris
* University of Paris-Nanterre
* University of Paris-Saclay

Looking at the track record of the ICA4 mentors alone, we see winners of the greatest scientific prizes: the Nobel, the Rumelhardt, the Von Neuman, the Barwise, the Mittelman, the de Carvalho- Heineken, the Mind & Brain, the Ampère, the Humboldt, the Onsager, the Templeton, th Heineman, the Swartz and many more. They are members of the most prestigious academies and learned societies, or have even presided over them, such as, Professor Toshio Fukuda, who has recently presided the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), the world's largest technical organisation, with 400,000 members. Moreover, Professor Eliezer Rabinovici, has been elected President of CERN (the European Nuclear Research Centre) and presented his lecture in the afternoon of the opening day, just before a lecture by Helga Nowotny, who was President and founder of the ERC, the European Research Council. The fellows are the next generation of the world’s elite researchers, privileged by being brought together in Paris.

Each day, the Fellows and their Mentors meet for **a closed 3-hour seminar**, during which two mentors launch the discussion with a presentation. Upon completion of the seminar, the Fellows then meet for 45 minutes to list the **key takeaways and ideas** that have emerged from the discussion, followed by a **collective brainstorming session**. This ensures that the output of collective intelligence is collected, formatted and capitalised.

The other half of the day is left free for participants to **reflect on the scientific discussions** in small groups. Such discussions are occasionally complemented by **lectures from the Chairs**. Finally, the Academia **travels to meet researchers** from some of the most prestigious universities in Paris. This includes a day at **Paris-Saclay**, a day at **Sorbonne University**, and finally, a day at the **ENS**. Upon completion of every morning's closed seminar at IAS, meetings and conferences are organised to encourage collective discussions and networking. The summary of each day is capitalised on [**the ICA4 blog**](https://www.intercontinental-academia.org/blog "ICA4 Blog").

ICA4 will continue in **cyberspace**, and has already started since June. In addition to a visual workplace, it also has access to **Teemew Campus Alpha**, the **3D virtual campus of the Paris IAS**, in which lounges, public seminar rooms, private meeting rooms and lounges are accessible to ICA4 Fellows and Mentors. Each Academia member possesses an avatar, created from his/her own image, which is then used to navigate through the IAS cyber campus. In short, while the Academia has already established a transdisciplinary and international event in its previous versions (ICA1, 2 and 3), it is now augmented by t**he collective intelligence of the Paris IAS**, as well as expanding into **cyberspace**. We hope that it will produce a research agenda commensurate to the challenges that await it.
