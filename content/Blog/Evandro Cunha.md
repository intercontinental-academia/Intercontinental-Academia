While expressing his fascination for linguistics in his research pitch, [**Evandro**](/fellows#cunha "Evandro Cunha") explained: "**Language** is arguably the most powerful tool that we humans developed to express our thoughts and feelings and to convey information."

Watch him as he explains more about his research!

Throughout **ICA4**, Evandro will be discussing **applications of language science in AI** and **the effects of technology on human communication**, particularly regarding manipulation, extremism and the spread of misinformation in the current scenario of pandemic and climate crisis.
