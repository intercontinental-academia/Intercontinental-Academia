An intense 10-day event on intelligence and AI is bound to discuss **robots** at some point! Thankfully, this is precisely what interests [**Yasutomo**](/fellows#kawanishi "Yasutomo Kawanishi"). He focuses on **robot vision for environmental understanding and surveillance for human understanding, especially pedestrian detection, tracking, retrieval, and recognition**.

He's presented his fascinating research in the above video.

At **ICA4**, Yasutomo focuses on two questions: “How can humans remember and recall the 3D environment around them?” and “Can this functionality be implemented on robots?”. Essentially, he will be working on incorporating knowledge from cognitive science and neuroscience into the robot vision field.

Sounds like robots are taking over!

More about the ICA4 fellow?

**Yasutomo Kawanishi** is a Visiting Associate Professor of Nagoya University and Team Leader in the Multimodal Data Recognition Research Team at RIKEN Guardian Robot Project. He received his Ph.D. degree in Informatics from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2012. Since 2021, he has been a team leader at RIKEN Guardian Robot Project. His main research field is Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
