[**Ithai**](/fellows#rabinowitch "Thai Rabinowitch") holds a very deep interest in **neurobiology from both a scientific and engineering perspective**. He is a neurobiologist and synthetic biologist, Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His research focuses on the tiny (1mm-long) nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, taking advantage of its relatively simple nervous system to unravel molecular and cellular underpinnings of presumed early precursors of **intelligence**. Concomitantly, the amenability of C.elegans to genetic manipulation makes it possible to reconfigure its neural circuits, and thus incorporate human design into its behaviour, opening the way for **a new animal-based form of AI**. He is currently combining all these strands to study the foundations of neural function both by exploring the basic nervous system of _C. elegans_ and by engineering new synaptic connections into this system.

At **ICA4**, Ithai attempts to collectively **conceptualize an imaginative, yet concrete, animal AI archetype**, and use it to contemplate the significance and foreseeable consequences of human-endowed animal intelligence.

**Listen to Ithai** as he explains more about **neurobiology** and the work he's been doing through **an ICA4 podcast** and interviewed by Mike Livermore:
