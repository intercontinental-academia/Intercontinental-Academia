As a philosopher of emotion, [**Laura**](/fellows#candiotto "Laura Candiotto") works on the **epistemology of emotions**. She's elaborated her research in the above pitch.

At **ICA4**, she will be exploring **the philosophical significance of our engagement with affective robots** simulating human emotions, as in the case of care robots. She would like to analyze the affective intentionality in the **human-robot embodied interactions** and discuss the **ethical and societal implications of affective robotics**.

How would human beings experience the interaction with affective robots? Such a fascinating question is yet to be answered precisely...

More about the ICA4 fellow:

**Laura Candiotto** is the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Senior Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin, Institute of Philosophy, Affective Societies Research Centre. From October 2021 she will be Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Ethics as Study in Human Value at the University of Pardubice. She was a visiting scholar at the IMèRA Institute for Advanced Study of the Aix-Marseille University (2018-2019) and she received her PhD in philosophy in 2011 at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice.
