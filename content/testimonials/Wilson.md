In the lead-up to ICA3 I had essentially no idea what to expect. What awaited me was a transformative and immersive exchange with an extraordinary group of people. The intellectual encounters, both one-on-one and in groups, with the other fellows and mentors were the highlight of my ICA - the chance to share ideas with field-defining figures and to get a real feel for their perspectives on their subjects, and to meet and forge links with a next generation of interdisciplinary academics. Some really fun memories too - Pulau Ubin, Boat Quay, Princeton, Stratford-upon-Avon. Thank you to all involved!
