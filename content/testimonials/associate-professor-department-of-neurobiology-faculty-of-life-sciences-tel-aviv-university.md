I was trained in a unique interdisciplinary program at Tel Aviv University leading directly to a masters degree. During those early years I was exposed to research and ideas from many disciplines. As years went by I became an expert in my research area, focusing on running my own lab. The intercontinental Academia reminded me of the importance of what it meant to be a pure academic again. I was exposed to ideas from multiple disciplines and met fellows with similar interests, but that use different research tools and perspectives. This event is intellectually and socially engaging at the highest possible level with the best mentors and fellows from all fields. This is a rare opportunity to disengage from the regular daily academic life and immerse in deep thinking. I am fortunate to be a part of a sub group of fellows that continues to collaborate on different topics.
