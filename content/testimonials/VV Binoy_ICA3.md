“In the realm of academics where discussions rarely cross the boundaries of the disciplines ICA is a rare opportunity for learning how to analyze topics from every angle possible. The guidance from the luminaries of science and social science and the diversity of thoughts brought into the discussion by the peers diverse in their subjects backgrounds and coming from different continents makes sessions of ICA a matchless experience.”
