Meeting people from various disciplines and several continents, getting to know them and working together in a long workshop format in two very different locations â€“ everything about the call for ICA 3 was so unusual and unique that I immediately wanted to participate. Fortunately, my research position allowed me to make time for it. The workshops were not something you could do casually. They were filled with talks by fascinating mentors and lively discussions, not least about what kind of outcome we would like to achieve. Two years later, I am still in regular contact with a group from ICA 3, working together on a topic that emerged from our workshop discussions.
