Pare then revealed a provocative example of an existing robot that is addressed to isolation in a contemporary urban environment.\nThe Fellows then took a break to explore the 3D virtual campus of the Paris IAS, called Teemew Campus Alpha, in which lounges, public seminar rooms, private meeting rooms and workshops are accessible to ICA4 Fellows and Mentors. Each Academia member possesses an avatar, created from his\u002Fher own image, which is then used to navigate through the IAS cyber campus.\nThe Fellows then discussed their follow-up tasks and next step(s). The first session of ICA4 in Paris was then wrapped up with a presentation from, this time, the Fellows! They highlighted some questions to explore further, ideas for research papers, an interdisciplinary manifesto for Artificial Intelligence and finally, they reflected on the key takeaways from the entire event.\nThe intellectually intense series of events was finally concluded with some cocktails at the Paris IAS, marking the very beginning of a series of scientific adventures which are yet to come, as the ICA4 Fellows continue to collectively explore some seemingly never-ending questions through combining various perspectives on Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, ultimately discovering and shaping how such complex matters should, and will be, embedded within societies...",tags:["Visual Processing","Situational Knowledge","Cognitive Systems","Representations",M,"Society","Technology","Robots"],published:true,pinned:B,post_title:"The Final Day: where we go from here...",date:"2021-10-26T23:00:00.000Z",authors:[{name:"Atrina Oraee"}],images:["\u002Fsnapseed-58.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-49.jpg","\u002F8.jpg","\u002Ffullsizerender-3.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-57.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-52.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-8.jpg","\u002F1.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-51.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-54.jpg"],youtube_video_id:"",audio:[],toc:[],body:{type:x,children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:N},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:y,to:C},children:[{type:a,value:O}]},{type:a,value:P},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:D,to:E},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:F}]}]}]},{type:a,value:Q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:G}]},{type:a,value:z},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:R}]},{type:a,value:S},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:H}]},{type:a,value:p}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:I,to:J},children:[{type:a,value:T}]},{type:a,value:U},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:V}]},{type:a,value:W},{type:b,tag:f,props:{href:X,title:A,rel:[t,u,v],target:w},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:A}]}]},{type:a,value:Y},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:Z}]},{type:a,value:_},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:$}]},{type:a,value:q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:aa}]},{type:a,value:q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ab}]},{type:a,value:z},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ac}]},{type:a,value:ad},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ae}]},{type:a,value:p}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:af},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ag}]},{type:a,value:q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ah}]},{type:a,value:q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ai}]},{type:a,value:aj},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ak}]},{type:a,value:p}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:al},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:am}]},{type:a,value:an},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:ao,to:ap},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:aq}]}]},{type:a,value:ar},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:as}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The top-down and bottom-up in visual processing"}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:at},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:y,to:C},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:o,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:y}]}]}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"A major question in visual processing is "},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:G}]},{type:a,value:".
