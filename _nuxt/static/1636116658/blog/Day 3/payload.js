There are many approaches to developing fair tests of cognition between species with different sensory and motor capabilities. It began with Darwin and Furness. Then, George Romanes (1884) focused on animal intelligence and later on, Kohler (1925) on insight learning.

However, associative or operant theories of learning were and are notoriously anti-cognitive. In the 1960s, there were attempts to reach apes alternative communication systems.

Brachiation is a form of long-armed ape locomotion. It uses dynamics of the pendulum, under-actuated mechanical system, variable constraint system, machine learning, AI, reinforce learning, soft computing (fuzzy, genetic algorithm). Regarding multi-locomotion types, in many cases, one creature has multiple types of locomotion in order to improve its mobility. The motivation of their study is to develop a robot mechanism and a control architecture that can achieve multiple locomotions.
