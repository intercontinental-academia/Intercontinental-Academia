Consequently, this can create, on a colossal scale, the perception-reasoning-action loop that characterises an autonomous as well as an intelligent actor. By enabling these systems to perceive, measure and evaluate the consequences of their actions and the operational quality of their judgement, these perception-action-evaluation loops will transform them into responsible, learning agents.
