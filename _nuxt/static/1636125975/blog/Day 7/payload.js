Two back to back scientific sessions were held in the morning, both of which described the current issues related to Artificial Intelligence and offers future perspectives. The first lecture was given by the Director of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS), Marc Mézard, who stressed that we need a better understanding of AI. This was followed by a talk from the famous economist, Philippe Aghion. He discussed the impact of automation on the labour force, and how AI can be used to boost innovation and growth through facilitating the process of creative destruction. Both mentors emphasised a need for a global set of ethical rules and regulations. The day continued with a presentation of ENS and concluded with a discussion session among the Fellows, as they began preparing their presentations for the plenary seminar on the Final Day of ICA4.",tags:["Neural Networks","Economics","Economic Growth","Labour","Innovation","Industry","Regulation","Creative Destruction","Data Science","Sustainable Growth"],published:true,pinned:A,post_title:"Day 7: \"We know everything, but we understand nothing!\"",date:"2021-10-25T23:00:00.000Z",authors:[{name:"Atrina Oraee"}],images:["\u002Fscreenshot-2021-10-27-at-06-49-27.png","\u002Fimg_5346.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-47.jpg","\u002Fscreenshot-2021-10-27-at-06-48-00.png"],youtube_video_id:"",audio:[],toc:[],body:{type:s,children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:B},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:t,to:L},children:[{type:a,value:t}]},{type:a,value:M},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:u,to:N},children:[{type:a,value:u}]},{type:a,value:O},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:C,to:D},children:[{type:a,value:P}]},{type:a,value:Q},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:R}]},{type:a,value:S},{type:b,tag:g,props:{href:T,title:U,rel:[v,w,x],target:y},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:V}]}]},{type:a,value:W},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:X}]},{type:a,value:Y},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:E,to:F},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:G}]}]}]},{type:a,value:Z},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:_}]},{type:a,value:$},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:q,to:H},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:q}]}]}]},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:r}]},{type:a,value:aa},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:I}]},{type:a,value:ab},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ac}]},{type:a,value:ad},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ae}]},{type:a,value:af},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ag}]},{type:a,value:ah},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ai}]},{type:a,value:aj}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Recent Progress and Future Challenges in AI"}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ak},{type:b,tag:f,props:{title:E,to:F},children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:G}]}]}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Mézard is a theoretical physicist with a personal interest in "},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"the development of a theoretical framework to explain how AI works, and more specifically how Deep Neural Networks operate"}]},{type:a,value:".
