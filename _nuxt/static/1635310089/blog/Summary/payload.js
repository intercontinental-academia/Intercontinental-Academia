Such discussions are occasionally complemented by lectures from the Chairs. Finally, the Academia travels to meet researchers from some of the most prestigious universities in Paris. This includes a day at Paris-Saclay, a day at Sorbonne University, and finally, a day at the ENS. Upon completion of every morning's closed seminar at IAS, meetings and conferences are organised to encourage collective discussions and networking.

In humans, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be crucial for cognitive functions such as working memory, decision making, and executive function. An early avenue of this research involved understanding how persistent neural activity may underlie working memory by sustaining stimulus information in the brain after the sensory cue has disappeared. Such persistence is linked to recurrent connectivity, which is lacking in most deep networks. Wang described his previous research using spiking networks and tools from dynamical systems to understand the attractor dynamics behind this form of memory. In the second half of the talk, he showcased his more recent work which uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a form of a model organism to probe how the PFC may perform multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously.

Huge innovations have been made in the predictive power of neural networks. Still, many of the conceptual foundations have been around since the 1980s.
