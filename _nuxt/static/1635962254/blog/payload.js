An early avenue of this research involved understanding how persistent neural activity may underlie working memory by sustaining stimulus information in the brain after the sensory cue has disappeared. Such persistence is linked to recurrent connectivity, which is lacking in most deep networks. Wang described his previous research using spiking networks and tools from dynamical systems to understand the attractor dynamics behind this form of memory. In the second half of the talk, he showcased his more recent work which uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a form of a model organism to probe how the PFC may perform multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously.

These authors proposed that Western education creates a context in which certain abstract relational concepts are learned, consistent with McClelland’s later work correlating sudoku puzzle performance to mathematical education level.

Aesthetic pleasure can be defined as the phylogenetically older system that is centred on the striatum.","Moreover, results of the relation between connectivity of the auditory cortex with the striatum and several behavioural results were presented (e.g. related to amusia, music-specific anhedonia). Dynamic causal modelling and predictive coding frameworks have been presented as possible explanations of the relationship between learning and reward in music. Predictions make the rewards evolve from a biological event to the expectation of the event.","Through the post-seminar collective discussions, the relevance of ","affective experience"," (pleasure and fear) in learning was emphasised. Discussions concluded with a rather open-ended question, leaving ICA4 Fellows wondering about whether or not AI should have a similar system for learning, and how should the reward and punishment be differentiated?\" Maybe AI does not need to understand or experience human emotions; it just needs to behave like a human by capturing the features of a dataset that correctly describes the behaviour...","High Energy Physics: Successes, Challenges and Magic","It was discussed that observing natural phenomena can motivate scientific enquiry and drive us to understand the unknown. Moreover, equations are a way to increase predictability. However, a single, compact and reductionist explanation for all phenomena in the universe may not necessarily exist. The scientific method requires that results are reproducible. The correspondence principle requires that new theories can explain all phenomena for which a preceding theory was valid. To understand a phenomenon, one has to identify the relevant players and determine the correct explanation scale.","In AI We Trust: Power, illusion and control of predictive algorithms","The session began with introducing the concept of singularity and defining it as a tipping point: a change of state that can lead to the collapse of a system. In an attempt to define Ethical AI, examples such as Transhumanism (ideas of transcending the limitations of a mortal body through information sharing) were discussed. Furthermore, the illusion that AI knows humans better than humans know themselves was elaborated, ultimately concluding by mentioning the existence of a possibility for human beings to both profit or suffer from an AI system depending on how it is applied.","\u002Ffellows#ralitera","Ben Guedj","\u002Ffellows#guedj","Benjamin Guedj","Why Consciousness?","Essentially, the seminar was focused on the purpose which consciousness serves. Consciousness was defined as the ability to do the following:","Perceive","Feel (emotions)","Think\u002Fintend","Carry out intentions (volition)","Myths and misunderstandings about responsibility for the unintended impact of AI","The talk mostly focused on responsibility for the unintended impact of Artificial Intelligence, based on the presenter's Council of Europe study. It was argued that Machine Learning's (ML) capacity to enable task automation and machine \"autonomy\" raise important questions about ",". Thus, responsibility-relevant attributes of ML were identified, for which an illustration is the data-driven profiling of individuals, and other ML applications, which may hold adverse impacts on human rights, on both individual and collective levels.","br","\nWhile responsibility is important for human beings, who are considered as moral agents, to maintain peaceful social co-operation within the community, only a few studies have focused on tackling the fundamental role of responsibility for individuals, as well as the society.","The impacts produced by complex socio-technical systems using ML technologies have generated a range of concerns that fall under the heading of \"algorithmic responsibility\". While existing laws have an important role to play in ensuring the accountability of algorithmic systems, the implications of these technologies for their interference with human rights need to be studied further. This has been the primary focus of Karen Yeung's research.","In a nutshell, two dimensions of responsibility are required:","Historic or retrospective responsibility:"," responsibility for conduct and events that occurred in the past","Prospective responsibility:"," roles and tasks that look to the future","Need for effective and legitimate mechanisms to protect human rights from AI applications.","Identifications of the appropriate responsibility model for allocating, distributing and preventing the various threats and risks.","Responsibility of states to ensure that these policy choices are made in a transparent and democratic manner, in order to effectively protect human rights.","Need for more interdisciplinary research","Application of the fundamental principle of reciprocity so as not to allow those who develop and run our advanced digital technologies and systems to increase and exercise their power without responsibility.","Data science and deep learning vs theory: two examples from economics and finance","The session included discussions on Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and some relevant theories in the field of economics and finance that share common disciplines. Certain examples from macroeconomics, in which characteristics of the underlying mechanisms for complex systems are of great interest, were then discussed in more detail. In such context, a misunderstanding between different disciplines was highlighted: ","the concept of equilibrium"," is of great significance in mainstream macroeconomics, whereas this is not the case for statistical physics (e.g., the \"equilibrium\" bias outside the econ area, discussed by Bonneuil & Boucekkine (2020)). Finally, the use of various ","methods"," and approaches, such as DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium), ABM (Agent-Based Modeling), and Neural Network-Based methods, in the field of macroeconomics were discussed.","Philipp Kellmeyer","\u002Fabout\u002Fica4#lahlou","William Hopkins","Toshio Fukuda","\u002Ffellows#cayco-gajic","Diego Frassinelli","Xiao-Jing Wang"," and ","Jay McClelland","Zaven Pare","Zaven Paré","Oksana Stalnov","Evandro Cunha","Henry Taylor","SCAI","Oron Shagrir","Melvin Wevers","Jakub Growiec","The ","Philippe Aghion","Mike Livermore","\u002Fsnapseed-3.jpg","\u002Fimg_4432-2.jpg","The ICA4 continued onto the second day, through which three seminars took place with mentors who had joined the first session in Paris from around the world!","The first lecture was by ",", a Nobel prize laureate, who focused on the convoluted concept of ","consciousness"," and its counterparts.","This was followed by a lecture from ",", who offered a rather critical point of view on the prevalence of AI, as well as some of its surrounding ","myths and misconceptions",".
