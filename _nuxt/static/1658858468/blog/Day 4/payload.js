These were followed by a symposium on AI at University Paris-Saclay. The symposium was followed by a half-day event with multiple workshops in which ICA4 mentors discussed major advances and issues surrounding AI with other world-class researchers such as Stanislas Dehaene.

In humans, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be crucial for cognitive functions such as working memory, decision making, and executive function. An early avenue of this research involved understanding how persistent neural activity may underlie working memory by sustaining stimulus information in the brain after the sensory cue has disappeared. Such persistence is linked to recurrent connectivity, which is lacking in most deep networks. Wang described his previous research using spiking networks and tools from dynamical systems to understand the attractor dynamics behind this form of memory. In the second half of the talk, he showcased his more recent work which uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a form of a model organism to probe how the PFC may perform multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously. These RNNs can then be used to address questions such as whether the PFC encodes cognitive building blocks in a compositional manner, similar to the psychological concepts of schema."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"A different distinction between human intelligence and AI..."}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ab},{type:b,tag:h,props:{title:v,to:"\u002Fmentors#mcclelland"},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"James McClelland"}]}]}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"While the latter (in particular machine learning algorithms) learns from statistics on large-scale input data, humans learn to learn from explanations structured by culturally invented systems.

These authors proposed that Western education creates a context in which certain abstract relational concepts are learned, consistent with McClelland’s later work correlating sudoku puzzle performance to mathematical education level.
