But of course, in reality, there are many states. Imagine you have three possible states. For example, suppose that instead of taking just a pulse or a non-pulse as inputs, the gate can take 3 volts, 6 volts, and 10 volts as inputs. Now we have three possible input states. And you can map these to TRUE\u002F1 and FALSE\u002F0 in different ways too. You could interpret 3 volts as TRUE\u002F1, and then interpret 6 and 10 volts each as FALSE\u002F0.
