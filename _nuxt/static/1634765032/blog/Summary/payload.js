Such discussions are occasionally complemented by lectures from the Chairs. Finally, the Academia travels to meet researchers from some of the most prestigious universities in Paris. This includes a day at Paris-Saclay, a day at Sorbonne University, and finally, a day at the ENS. Upon completion of every morning's closed seminar at IAS, meetings and conferences are organised to encourage collective discussions and networking.
