Upon completion of the seminar, the Fellows then meet for 45 minutes to list the key takeaways and ideas that have emerged from the discussion, followed by a collective brainstorming session. This ensures that the output of collective intelligence is collected, formatted and capitalised.\nThe other half of the day is left free for participants to reflect on the scientific discussions in small groups. Such discussions are occasionally complemented by lectures from the Chairs.\nThe very first lecture of ICA4 - Session 1 came from Robert Zatorre who took us into the fascinating world of music while explaining the relationship between perception, predictions, and pleasure!\nThis was followed by another lecture that introduced a rather different perspective on AI and was presented by Eliezer Rabinovici. The lecture mostly explored the complexities of scientific enquiries and methods in the context of AI.\nBefore leaving for cocktails and welcome speeches in the chambers of Paris IAS, a final lecture was given by Helga Nowotny, who emphasised an urgent need for establishing a context-sensitive AI control system.",tags:["Perception","Pleasure","Music",L,"Artificial Intelligence","Cognition","Neuroscience","Technology"],published:true,pinned:E,post_title:"Day 1: \"The future needs wisdom!”",date:"2021-10-18T21:00:00.000Z",authors:[{name:"Atrina Oraee"}],images:["\u002Fsnapseed.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-5.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-2.jpg","\u002Fsnapseed-7.jpg","\u002Fimg_4286.jpg","\u002Fimg_4044.jpg","\u002Fimg_4211.jpg"],youtube_video_id:"",audio:[],toc:[],body:{type:y,children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:M},{type:b,tag:f,props:{href:N,title:z,rel:[q,r,s],target:t},children:[{type:a,value:z}]},{type:a,value:O},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:P,to:Q},children:[{type:a,value:R}]},{type:a,value:S},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:A,to:T},children:[{type:a,value:A}]},{type:a,value:U},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:V}]},{type:a,value:W},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:X}]},{type:a,value:Y},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:Z}]},{type:a,value:_}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:$},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:aa}]},{type:a,value:ab},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ac}]},{type:a,value:B},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:C,to:ad},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:C}]}]},{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ae},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:af}]},{type:a,value:ag},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:v,to:F},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:v}]}]},{type:a,value:ah},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ai}]},{type:a,value:aj},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ak}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:al},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:w,to:G},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:w}]}]},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:am},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:an}]},{type:a,value:B},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ao}]},{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ap},{type:b,tag:f,props:{href:H,title:x,rel:[q,r,s],target:t},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:x}]}]},{type:a,value:aq},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:ar}]},{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Perception, prediction, and pleasure: What can music teach us about neurocognition\u002Fintelligence?"}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:I},{type:b,tag:g,props:{title:v,to:F},children:[{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:v}]}]}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"It was stated during the seminar that the brain represents the properties of the environment and guides behaviour through evaluation and reward.
