In humans, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be crucial for cognitive functions such as working memory, decision making, and executive function. An early avenue of this research involved understanding how persistent neural activity may underlie working memory by sustaining stimulus information in the brain after the sensory cue has disappeared. Such persistence is linked to recurrent connectivity, which is lacking in most deep networks. Wang described his previous research using spiking networks and tools from dynamical systems to understand the attractor dynamics behind this form of memory. In the second half of the talk, he showcased his more recent work which uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a form of a model organism to probe how the PFC may perform multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously. These RNNs can then be used to address questions such as whether the PFC encodes cognitive building blocks in a compositional manner, similar to the psychological concepts of schema."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Following this talk, "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"McClelland"}]},{type:a,value:" highlighted "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"a different distinction between human intelligence and AI"}]},{type:a,value:". While the latter (in particular machine learning algorithms) learns from statistics on large-scale input data, humans learn to learn from explanations structured by culturally invented systems. Indeed, humans fail to perform in systematic ways, which we would expect if the structure were built into our cognitive functionality.

In other words, they are specific, local, and societal settings where humans are expected to behave predictably, e.g., airport, metro, cash machine, etc. ","The question now is: why do we have these installations? Because ","installations channel many of our behaviours"," and consequently make us very efficient, although our short memory and cognitive processing are very limited compared to animals. Installations are ","redundant",", and redundancy produces resilience and learning.","Moreover, certain questions on designing trade-off issues were raised: which agency for whom? AI agent? what kind of competence for the AI? What affordances? What rules? What degree of awareness? To whom does the agent report? How is it evaluated? He also added the “privacy dilemma.” In other words, for better service, one must disclose information. Is there an “agency dilemma”? Can we make it explicit? Because the agency is distributed, so the responsibility is shared. It means that we now have the “many hands\" problem. Thus, credentials for AI were suggested, which include ","values"," (what does it try to optimise), ","ownership"," (who takes responsibility for its actions), ","principles of action"," (rules, algorithms, domain of awareness and action), ","track record"," (list of transactions executed, includes initial training).","To conclude, ICA4 Fellows were left with some questions as food for thought. For each activity, do we want to augment existing agents with more agency? If so, which ones? Humans? Material objects? Social system? New agents? Who learns what? What values do we want to foster? What do we want AI for must be addressed for each activity, starting from the activity and discussed?","Perspective on Artificial Intelligence research from studies on Agency, self-recognition and social cognition in animals","The session began by discussing humans constructed concepts to reflect intellectual abilities in various domains of cognitive functions. In this sense, we use tests like the WAIS or Stanford Binet to quantify and scale performance to standards for specific age classes. These tests rely heavily on language. There are many approaches to developing fair tests of cognition between species with different sensory and motor capabilities. It began with Darwin and Furness. Then, George Romanes (1884) focused on animal intelligence and later on, Kohler (1925) on insight learning. Within the same field, Robert Yerkes (1916) worked on “The mental life of monkeys and apes: a study of ideational behavior”. Yerkes later developed the IQ test used by the army in WW1 (army alpha test).","Upon drawing on some of the literature, several videos were played, in which apes carries out various tasks including retrieving a peanut in the bottom of a tube followed by a video from an ape imitating a human, and so on. Several animals passed the mark test. E.g., magpies with a yellow stick in their neck can identify it and try to remove using the mirror. Cortical parcellation of chimpanzee brain - compared to humans, the ones that passed the test show differences in some cortices. Grey matter differences between MSR+ vs. MSR-. They also analysed the anterior cingulate since such neurones are rather long and connect the anterior cingulate with the insula.","Moreover, results from studies that showed that human children outperformed apes on the social, but not physical, cognition tasks were presented and discussed. Much like the research in AI, Most early comparative studies of cognition and intelligence were strongly rooted in associative learning theory. However, associative or operant theories of learning were and are notoriously anti-cognitive. In the 1960s, there were attempts to reach apes alternative communication systems. The goal of the ape language studies was to determine whether language is uniquely human. The answer depends on how we define language.","However, is it language? There is very little evidence for declarative production (e.g., turn on the TV, give me an onion) in communication signals by primates and other animals. The other question is: are social stimuli rewarding? For chimpanzees, yes. Experiment: touch one button to see other chimpanzees or another button to see random animals. The chimp chose to press the button to see other chimps. Thus, the role of reward guides the learning and behaviour of animals. Although animal cognition is often used to explain animal behaviour, most can be explained by an associative learning mechanism.","AI and Robots for Future: The Moon Shot Project","\u002Fmentors#fukuda","Robots are avatars that pop up to help when humans need them. There is an information and physical interaction between robots and humans. Toshio showed several multi-scale robots, e.g., monkey-type robots, multi-locomotion, intelligent cane, etc. One of these robots is the Brachiator I-III. Brachiation is a form of long-armed ape locomotion. It uses dynamics of the pendulum, under-actuated mechanical system, variable constraint system, machine learning, AI, reinforce learning, soft computing (fuzzy, genetic algorithm). Regarding multi-locomotion types, in many cases, one creature has multiple types of locomotion in order to improve its mobility. The motivation of their study is to develop a robot mechanism and a control architecture that can achieve multiple locomotions. Hybrid computational intelligence, i.e., AI and brain interface were also commented upon by the speaker while showing a series of related videos. An example of such videos illustrated the Boston dynamics atlas and others: three robots dancing and jumping which was quite impressive!","Moreover, AI+Robot+IoT (Internet of Things), the use of robots in mega-trend (energy, urbanisation, food, ageing, global warming, robot, and AI) were discussed. This was followed by further discussions on autonomous cars, which may be safer than human drivers, mixed reality, the Eve project (a transparent body that simulates the human body), cyborg technology (fusion of robot and animal), and multiple robots (communication among robots).","Alex Cayco-Gajic","\u002Ffellows#frassinelli","culture",". For example, he described a classic study by Scribner and Cole in 1973 which showed that non-Western cultures often lack a concept of absolute number and tend to classify objects based on concrete situations rather than abstract category membership. These authors proposed that Western education creates a context in which certain abstract relational concepts are learned, consistent with McClelland’s later work correlating sudoku puzzle performance to mathematical education level. McClelland closed by reiterating that AI learns by examples but humans learn by explanations and that his explanation-based learning (rather than built-in structure) may underlie our propensity for one-shot learning.","Upon completion of the talks by ICA4 Mentors, Paris-Saclay hosted ","ICA4 mentors and Paris-Saclay researchers discussed major advances and issues surrounding AI","humans use symbolic and recursive strategies on prediction tasks with complex sequences","Finally, the intellectually intense day came to an end with a talk in which "," discussed his ","artistic works based on electronic marionettes"," and his collaborations with robotics specialists in Japan.

Perhaps it's necessary to describe what computational indeterminacy is, and then look at its applications and philosophical questions.","So, what is computational indeterminacy anyway?","Suppose you have a computer, carrying out all sorts of tasks. Electrical signals are pulsing through it, flowing across its circuits, inputs flowing in, outputs flowing out. Now, we can ask the question: ","what is the computer doing?"," Or, more precisely: ","which computations is it actually carrying out?","This may seem easy to answer: you simply look at the machine and find out which computations it’s carrying out, surely? Well, no. Here is where the issue of computational indeterminacy comes in, and to understand it we’ll need a tiny bit of logic.","Computers make use of what are called ","logic gates",", or simply: gates. Each gate takes a certain set of inputs, then (based on the rules that govern the gate), it gives a certain output. So let’s take a really simple gate, with two inputs, and one output. Inputs and outputs are in the form of electrical pulses (so it can take in up to two electrical pulses as inputs, and give up to one electrical pulse as an output). Furthermore, the ","absence"," of a pulse can also be an output or an input as well.","Let’s say the gate follows this rule:","GATE-RULE:","IF I RECEIVE TWO ELECTRICAL PULSES, THEN I WILL OUTPUT ONE PULSE. IF I DO NOT RECEIVE TWO ELECTRICAL PULSES, I WILL NOT OUTPUT A PULSE.","More simply, ","the gate’s job is to only output a pulse if it receives two pulses as input. Otherwise, it stays totally silent."," So far so good...right?","Now the core question: ","what is the gate computing?","AND-RULE:","IF I RECEIVE TWO INPUTS OF ‘TRUE’ (OR ‘1’) THEN I WILL OUTPUT ‘TRUE’ (OR ‘1’). OTHERWISE, I WILL OUTPUT ‘FALSE’ (OR ‘0’).","It initially looks pretty clear that the gate is computing AND. If you compare the AND-RULE to the GATE-RULE, they look pretty much the same. After all, to get the AND-RULE from the GATE-RULE, you just need to substitute an electrical pulse for ‘TRUE’ or ‘1’, and the absence of a pulse for ‘FALSE’ or ‘0’.","So what’s the problem? It stems from the way we map pulses to ‘TRUE’ (or ‘1’) and non-pulses to ‘FALSE’ (or ‘0’). If we interpret a pulse as TRUE, and a non-pulse as FALSE, then the gate will indeed compute the function AND (characterised by the AND-RULE, above). But that’s just a choice we made, to map pulses to TRUE and non-pulses to FALSE in these ways.","OR-RULE","IF I RECEIVE TWO INPUTS OF ‘FALSE’ (OR ‘0’) THEN I WILL OUTPUT ‘FALSE’ (OR ‘0’). OTHERWISE, I WILL OUTPUT ‘TRUE’ (OR ‘1’).","Whether the gate is computing AND or OR is a matter of how we interpret it."," It’s a matter of how we map electrical pulses to TRUE\u002F1, or FALSE\u002F0. There’s no correct answer to which computation the gate itself is doing, that’s a matter of how we interpret it. That’s computational indeterminacy.","Obviously, a computer is more than just one gate. It’s many many gates. As you add more and more gates into the system, the indeterminacy is going to multiply and multiply. Just one gate can give you OR or AND, but when you put enough gates together (like there are in a modern computer) the indeterminacy is only going to get more complex.","What is it good for?","Why is it so important?"," This is something Jack Copeland focussed on in his talk. Return to our example of a gate that could be OR or AND. Imagine you have a computer, and it has two different tasks to perform. Suppose that, in order to perform task 1, it will need an OR gate. In order to perform task 2, it needs an AND gate. Here’s the crucial question: ","will this computer need two different gates to do this?","No!"," All you need is two different systems that interpret the gate (these are what Jack Copeland calls ‘probes’). One probe interprets the gate as an AND gate, the other interprets it as an OR gate. So you only need one gate, and it can do the job of an AND gate, and an OR gate. Your computer can perform both tasks with only one gate. You get two gates for the price of one. Gates, it turns out, are great at multi-tasking.","This could be especially useful in reducing redundancy in machine design."," Rather than using huge numbers of gates, each of which doing one job, we might hope to get each one to multi-task. Ultimately, we might hope to end up with ","one large central system, with many gates all doing their thing",". We might then hope that there could be multiple probes, each of which interprets this system in a different way. Maybe one of them interprets the system in a way that is relevant for one task, another which is relevant for another, and so on. All of the tasks are performed by just one system, but it gets put to many different uses, by being interpreted in different ways by different probes. ","It’s like getting many many different computations, all for the price of one!","Philosophical questions:","Let’s leave machine design to one side, and concentrate on the philosophical implications of all of this. Oron Shagrir takes the indeterminacy one step further. Above, we used the example of just two possible states (pulse and non-pulse) and two interpretations (TRUE\u002F1 and FALSE\u002F0). But of course, in reality, there are many states. Imagine you have three possible states. For example, suppose that instead of taking just a pulse or a non-pulse as inputs, the gate can take 3 volts, 6 volts, and 10 volts as inputs. Now we have three possible input states. And you can map these to TRUE\u002F1 and FALSE\u002F0 in different ways too. You could interpret 3 volts as TRUE\u002F1, and then interpret 6 and 10 volts each as FALSE\u002F0. Or you could go the other way, and interpret 3 or 6 volts as TRUE\u002F1, and 10 volts as FALSE\u002F0 (obviously there will be many more possible interpretations).","Now, by making things just a tiny bit more complicated in this way (by scrapping just pulse and non-pulse and replacing them with 3, 6 and 10 voltages, and mapping them in different ways to TRUE\u002F1, and FALSE\u002F0), the number of computations that a gate can compute will go up. One gate could not just do OR or AND, but also other ones as well, such as XOR (XOR is ‘exclusive-or’: it will output ‘TRUE’ only in the case that ","exactly one"," of the inputs is ‘TRUE’).","Here we encounter a problem. As we have seen, ","one physical system can perform many different computations at once (in our first example, the really simple gate can compute OR and AND at the same time). But which physical systems can be correctly interpreted in these ways? Where does this end?","Rocks are not computers!","These are called ‘triviality results’, first introduced by philosophers such as Hilary Putnam. These are cases where you basically end up saying that everything is a computer. But we don’t want that. ","We want to say that laptops, smartphones (maybe brains) compute things. Rocks, sticks, stones, and sealing wax do not. We need to draw the line in the right place.","Oron’s own proposal is that we use ","semantics"," to solve this problem. The really computational states are the ones that have ","semantic content","meanings",", that ","represent things"," in the world. ","Contrary to what a lot of philosophers have thought, computation may be a deeply semantic phenomenon...","\u002Ffellows#wevers","\u002Ffellows#growiec","Notwithstanding the impressive technological innovations in Deep Neural Networks, ","Mézard raises three main issues",":","training of the networks"," still requires vast amounts of data, which is unpractical and a sign that the networks do not mimic the human brain.

Much of the innovation related to AI is currently concentrated in such companies. To give AI more potential, we need to rethink ways to stimulate innovation while also making it sustainable.
