There are already billions of them connected to the network, but not really interconnected yet. The “Internet of Things” may operate such an interconnection by connecting perception and action systems (which are precisely the before mentioned sensors and actuators) to the information processing systems. Consequently, this can create, on a colossal scale, the perception-reasoning-action loop that characterises an autonomous as well as an intelligent actor. By enabling these systems to perceive, measure and evaluate the consequences of their actions and the operational quality of their judgement, these perception-action-evaluation loops will transform them into responsible, learning agents. To design, direct and control such recently established entities is a gigantic scientific problem. It is no longer theoretical: the movement is underway, on a planetary scale of almost unimaginable complexity! It is first and foremost a challenge to the sciences of matter and engineering.","Artificial Intelligence","cyberspace","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","_blank","2021-10-15T22:00:00.000Z","https:\u002F\u002Fica.paris-iea.fr,","Paris","2021-10-18T22:00:00.000Z","em","References:","nuxt-link","\u002Fabout\u002Fica4#lahlou","Lahlou, Saadi",". \"Welcome to ICA4, Paris IAS\".
